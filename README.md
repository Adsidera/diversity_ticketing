## Contributing workflow

Here’s how we suggest you go about proposing a change to this project:

1. [Fork this project][fork] to your account.
2. [Create a branch][branch] for the change you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork.
4. [Send a pull request][pr] from your fork’s branch to our `master` branch.
    - For bonus points, include screenshots in the description. Command + Ctrl + Shift + 4 in OS X lets you copy a screen selection to your clipboard, which GitHub will let you paste right into the description.

Using the web-based interface to make changes is fine too, and will help you
by automatically forking the project and prompting to send a pull request.
