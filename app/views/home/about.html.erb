<h1>About</h1>


  <p>diversitytickets.org is a website which helps conference organisers reach out to minority groups by offering them ticket and travel grants. They can do so by adding their own event/conference and specifying how many tickets will be given away. Once the event is approved, it becomes publicly listed on the website and applicants can apply for it.</p>
  <p>The app was created to make the work around diversity ticketing easier for event organisers as well as members of underrepresented groups in tech. Organisers donâ€™t have to set up forms for the applicants to fill out and can focus on other organisational work, while applicants have a good overview of which events are currently offering diversity tickets, through the event listing.</p>
  <p>Last but not least, the app is Open Source and was built by RubyMonstas, with the support of Travis Foundation.</p>
